# cgc-monitor
The Cyber Grand Challenge forensics platform and automated analysis tools based on Simics.
The CGC Monitor provides two primary functions: 1)forensic analysis for purposes of vetting software submissions; 
and, 2) automated support for analysis of CGC binaries via an Ida Pro gdb client.  Both functions rely on the Simics full system 
simulator.  This paper describes the CGC Monitor https://www.dfrws.org/sites/default/files/session-files/paper_cyber_grand_challenge_cgc_monitor_-_a_vetting_system_for_the_darpa_cyber_grand_challenge.pdf

**(This project has evolved to a more general purpose reverse engineering platform at https://github.com/mfthomps/RESim)**

The CGC Monitor lacks complete documentation, though the basic chain of scripts and dependencies can be derived by starting with:
zk/monitorUtils/cgc-monitor.md to  understand the forensic vetting function used in CFE; and with
idaClient/README_IDA_CLIENT.md for the analyst functions. The Ida client is also summerized in [idaClient.pdf](idaClient.pdf)

A brief summary of the high level directories follows:

* idaClient -- scripts used on a client computer to interact with a CGC Monitor
* simics/monitorCore -- the primary Simics scripts that provide monitoring of software
* simics/simicsScripts -- utilties to start the monitor and manage the monitor, including ts disk image files
* simics/ida -- Ida Python scripts used by the Ida Pro client.
* simics/slaveInstall -- utilities to help manage provisioning of a CGC Monitor slave
* zk -- utilities and services required by the monitor, including software that runs on emulated infrastructure
* game_notify -- interacts with CGC game infrastructure to obtain data to be vetted.
* scoreUtils -- utilities for analysis of CFE artifacts
